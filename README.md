# Cloud Resource Optimization using Reinforcement Learning

## Overview

This project implements a cloud auto-scaling system using Reinforcement Learning (RL).
The objective is to dynamically scale cloud compute instances based on workload demand while balancing:

* Response time (latency)
* Error rate (SLA violations)
* Infrastructure cost
* Scaling stability

Two RL algorithms are implemented and compared:

* Deep Q-Network (DQN)
* Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

The system is built using Gymnasium and Stable-Baselines3.

# Project Architecture

The project follows a modular, research-oriented design:

├── envs/       → Gymnasium RL environment wrapper

## 1. Simulation Layer (`sim/`)

This layer contains the cloud system model.
It is completely independent of reinforcement learning.

### Responsibilities

* Workload generation (stochastic demand)
* Instance scaling logic
* Queue-based performance modeling
* Cost computation
* System metrics calculation

### System Modeling Assumptions

The simulation models a simplified cloud service using:

* Request arrival rate (λ)
* Service rate per instance (μ)
* Instance count (N)
* M/M/1-style queue approximation for response time
* Error rate under overload conditions

### Why This Separation Matters

* Reusability of the simulator
* Clean testing
* Clear abstraction boundaries
* Independent experimentation

---

## 2. RL Environment (`envs/`)

The environment wraps the simulator into a Gymnasium-compatible interface.

### State Space

```
[
  λ_t,
  N_t,
  utilization,
  error_rate,
  normalized_response_time
]
```

### Action Space

```
0 → Scale Down
1 → Maintain
2 → Scale Up
```

### Reward Function

The reward balances:

* Latency penalty
* Error penalty (highest priority)
* Cost penalty
* Scaling stability penalty

The reward is normalized to improve PPO/DQN training stability.

## 3. Agents (`agents/`)

Two reinforcement learning algorithms are implemented:

### PPO

* Stable policy-gradient method
* Handles stochastic environments effectively
* Produces smoother scaling behavior

### DQN

* Value-based method
* Efficient for discrete action spaces
* Faster initial convergence in simple environments

Both algorithms use multilayer perceptron (MLP) policies.

# Resources Modeled in the System

The system models the following cloud resources and metrics:

## 1. Compute Instances

* Number of active instances (N)
* Bounded between minimum and maximum limits

## 2. Workload (Request Arrival Rate)

* Stochastic workload
* Modeled with noise
* Extendable to bursty or periodic patterns

## 3. Processing Capacity

* Service rate per instance (μ)
* Total capacity = N × μ

## 4. Performance Metrics

* CPU utilization
* Response time
* Error rate (when overloaded)

## 5. Operational Cost

* Linear cost per instance
* Total cost proportional to number of instances

---

# Why This Architecture is Strong

## 1. Modular Design

Simulation and RL are decoupled.
This enables:

* Independent testing
* Easier experimentation
* Cleaner debugging
* Feature scalability

---

## 2. Research-Grade MDP Formulation

The system is formally modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP):

* **State**: workload and system metrics
* **Action**: scaling decision
* **Reward**: multi-objective optimization
* **Transition**: stochastic workload evolution

This makes the formulation academically defensible.

---

## 3. Extensibility

The system can be extended with:

* Bursty workload patterns
* Delayed scaling effects
* Memory and network modeling
* Multi-resource optimization
* Continuous action space scaling

---

## 4. Algorithm Comparison Capability

Because both PPO and DQN are implemented:

* Performance comparison is possible
* Stability differences can be analyzed
* Convergence behavior can be studied
* Policy smoothness can be evaluated

# Advantages of RL-Based Auto Scaling

Traditional threshold-based auto-scalers:

* React late
* Oscillate frequently
* Over-provision resources
* Cannot learn workload patterns

RL-based scaling:

* Learns optimal scaling policies
* Balances cost and performance
* Reduces SLA violations
* Adapts to stochastic workloads
* Minimizes unnecessary scaling actions

---

# Technical Stack

* Python 3.9+
* Gymnasium
* Stable-Baselines3
* PyTorch (backend)
* NumPy
* Matplotlib (evaluation and visualization)
* PyTest (unit testing)

---

# Conclusion

This project demonstrates how reinforcement learning can be applied to cloud resource optimization using a clean, modular, and research-oriented architecture.

It provides:

* A mathematically grounded MDP formulation
* A scalable Gymnasium environment
* PPO and DQN implementations
* A structured experimental framework

The system serves as a strong foundation for advanced cloud optimization research and experimentation.
